Few things are more frustrating than a Flutz. Cold toes after a short time on the ice is one of them. You warm up, feel great, and then—ten minutes later—your forefoot has gone numb. The timing is there, the muscle memory is there, but the feeling is gone. Every skater knows the moment.

      <p className="mt-6 text-slate-600">
        WarmEdge warming solutions are designed for that exact frustration. Built
        for skaters who are ultra-sensitive to changes in feel and feedback, our
        approach focuses on minimal sensation, science-based materials, and carefully
        engineered design. The goal is simple: help manage cold toes without
        changing how skating feels.
