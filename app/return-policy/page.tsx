        Laces are not eligible for return. Due to their specialized properties
        and fit-sensitive nature, we strongly recommend confirming the correct
        length before placing an order. Listed lengths follow industry-standard
        and boot-specific sizing guidelines.

        Skate hard guards and soft soakers must show no indication of use.
        This includes, but is not limited to, signs of skating activity,
        moisture exposure, or contact with ice surfaces.
